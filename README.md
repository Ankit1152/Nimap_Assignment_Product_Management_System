# Product Management System

This is a Spring Boot-based RESTful web application built as part of the Nimap Infotech assignment. It provides complete CRUD operations for managing **Categories** and **Products**, ensuring a **one-to-many relationship** (one category can have multiple products). The application also implements **server-side pagination**, **DTO mapping**, and proper **exception handling**.
